@defeat

= Total Defeat

Our forces are no match for those of the reactionaries. Reichsbanner fighters are quickly overpowered by the forces of the Stahlhelm, SA, and Reichswehr. Many are killed before the rest surrender. Our remaining leaders flee the country or face execution, as the reactionaries take absolute power over Germany.

Our resistance will be recorded in the history books, and in the future, our names will be honored. But for now, all is lost.

The initial phase of the action ends, and somehow, both sides remain standing.

The war settles into fixed battle lines. This will not be a quick coup, but a long civil war. The nation will destroy itself before it can be rebuilt again.

While we might want to call for foreign assistance, the foreign powers see the "Prussian Coup" as a purely internal matter.

Some political thinkers believe that the proliferation of minor parties is responsible for the instability of the republic.

The KPD is shocked at our unwillingness to pursue any agrarian reforms at the moment but concedes. They will surely demand other concessions if not this, however.

In order to finance their other programs, the KPD have made a plan for the seizure of assets from the rich, nationalization of the Reichsbank, and other such measures. Such an action would however surely provoke a confrontation with the capitalists.

- @accept_seizure: Allow the decree.

We allow the KPD to go forward with the decree, greatly increasing the budget available to be spent by the government on other directives.

Wanting to bring the economy under state control, the KPD has prepared a decree for the mass nationalizations of industry, claiming it will bring an end to the Great Depression and by dismantling capitalism ensure one never happens again.

- @allow_nationalization: Allow the decree.
- @refuse_nationalization: Convince the KPD to drop the decree.

We allow the decree to go ahead, with large swaths of the economy soon being quickly brought under public control. [? if economic_minister_party == "KPD" : Control over the state-run industries falls to the KPD-run Economic Ministry, leading to an expanding bureaucratic base of their party. ?]

We convince the KPD not to go ahead with the mass nationalization, though they by no means have dropped the idea, and likely only backed down due to our position of relative strength in comparison. They campaign against us and overall this spat does not bode well for our cooperation long term.

The KPD, arguing its necessity in rooting out the reactionaries for good, has drafted an "Enabling Act" giving even further sweeping powers to the presidency as well as the cabinet. [? if kpd_party_leader != "Conciliators" : The KPD is quite insistent on this proposal, leading many to believe it as a pretext for a consolidation of power into their hands. ?]

We allow the KPD to go ahead with their Enabling Act. Immediately, mass crackdowns are launched on the remaining Nazi Party bases, while similar ones are prepared against the other right-wing parties that were banned. Reformists and Neorevisionists protest our compliance in what they view as blatant consolidation of power by the Soviets.
