= Direct Democracy

As part of the Weimar constitution, petitions, if they gain enough signatures, may be put to nationwide referendums for the people to directly vote on laws. We may not be in government, but we can try to bypass this and campaign ourselves for certain laws or actions, which, even if fail, may invigorate our supporters or provide publicity.

Should we initiate any petitions?

We initiate a petition for the implementation of a land reform program and launch a campaign through the countryside to get it the signatures it needs. Many of our grassroots members in their campaigning for the petition campaign alongside the Communists, who quickly involve themselves in the referendum [? if kpd_relation < 25 : despite their hostility toward Social Democracy?]. Soon it gains enough signatures to be put to a referendum, which the DNVP aggressively campaigns against, leading to a decrease in their rural support as previously reactionary farmers turn against the party.

We launch a campaign for this petition through the industrial regions of Germany, from workplace to workplace [? if works_councils >= 2 : and works council to works council ?] as soon the KPD joins in our campaign.

We initiate a petition for the legalization of abortion, which quickly whips up a storm. Of course, the progressive parties all throw their support behind the petition, but the Center Party and the DNVP both staunchly oppose it. Whether the controversy helps the SPD or not is uncertain, but it certainly helps the more minor progressive parties, who use it as an opportunity to gain publicity, one such example being the DDP which has grown its reputation amongst the middle class significantly.
